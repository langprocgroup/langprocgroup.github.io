However, this measure has long been thought to be best considered a matter of degree. We present an information-theoretic measure, called informational fusion, to quantify the degree of fusion of a given set of morphological features in a surface form, which naturally provides such a graded scale. Informational fusion is able to encapsulate not only concatenative, but also nonconcatenative morphological systems (e.g. Arabic), abstracting away from any notions of morpheme segmentation. We then show, on a sample of twenty-one languages, that our measure recapitulates the usual linguistic classifications for concatenative systems, and provides new measures for nonconcatenative ones. We also evaluate the long-standing hypotheses that more frequent forms are more fusional, and that paradigm size anticorrelates with degree of fusion. We do not find evidence for the idea that languages have characteristic levels of fusion; rather, the degree of fusion varies across part-of-speech within languages.","tags":[],"title":"An Information-Theoretic Characterization of Morphological Fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Dyer","Richard Futrell","Zoey Liu","Greg Scontras"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641846263,"objectID":"9ffc459560a8a5623d1445ffd4c3dd5b","permalink":"https://langprocgroup.github.io/publication/dyer-2021-predicting/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T20:24:23.222875Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dyer-2021-predicting/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Predicting cross-linguistic adjective order with information gain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huteng Dai","Richard Futrell"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641846263,"objectID":"4e68fac73c9dbf56a560f7ae54805fad","permalink":"https://langprocgroup.github.io/publication/dai-2021-simple/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T20:24:23.073646Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dai-2021-simple/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a simple and highly general phonotactic learner which induces a probabilistic finite-state automaton from word-form data.

To understand if and how morphosyntactic alignment affects contextual embedding spaces, we train classifiers to recover the subjecthood of mBERT embeddings in transitive sentences (which do not contain overt information about morphosyntactic alignment) and then evaluate them zero-shot on intransitive sentences (where subjecthood classification depends on alignment), within and across languages. We find that the resulting classifier distributions reflect the morphosyntactic alignment of their training languages. Our results demonstrate that mBERT representations are influenced by high-level grammatical features that are not manifested in any one input sentence, and that this is robust across languages. Further examining the characteristics that our classifiers rely on, we find that features such as passive voice, animacy and case strongly correlate with classification decisions, suggesting that mBERT does not encode subjecthood purely syntactically, but that subjecthood embedding is continuous and dependent on semantic and discourse factors, as is proposed in much of the functional linguistics literature. Together, these results provide insight into how grammatical features manifest in contextual embedding spaces, at a level of abstraction not covered by previous work.","tags":[],"title":"Deep Subjecthood: Higher-Order Grammatical Features in Multilingual BERT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Futrell"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641846263,"objectID":"6891a6e701665c17452814a95372958c","permalink":"https://langprocgroup.github.io/publication/futrell-2021-information/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T20:24:23.29255Z","relpermalink":"/publication/futrell-2021-information/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An information-theoretic account of semantic inference in word production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Himanshu Yadav","Samar Husain","Richard Futrell"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641846263,"objectID":"2195b743bc5cd2db1c70769c72b7830f","permalink":"https://langprocgroup.github.io/publication/yadav-2021-dependency/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T20:24:23.362531Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yadav-2021-dependency/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Do dependency lengths explain constraints on crossing dependencies?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Hahn","Judith Degen","Richard Futrell"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641846263,"objectID":"2462aaba165c90a27e4bc869cdfb4118","permalink":"https://langprocgroup.github.io/publication/hahn-2021-modeling/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T20:24:23.506418Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hahn-2021-modeling/","section":"publication","summary":"Memory limitations are known to constrain language comprehension and production, and have been argued to account for crosslinguistic word order regularities. However, a systematic assessment of the role of memory limitations in language structure has proven elusive, in part because it is hard to extract precise large-scale quantitative generalizations about language from existing mechanistic models of memory use in sentence processing. We provide an architecture-independent information-theoretic formalization of memory limitations which enables a simple calculation of the memory efficiency of languages. Our notion of memory efficiency is based on the idea of a memory--surprisal tradeoff: a certain level of average surprisal per word can only be achieved at the cost of storing some amount of information about past context. Based on this notion of memory usage, we advance the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis: the order of elements in natural language is under pressure to enable favorable memory-surprisal tradeoffs. We derive that languages enable more efficient tradeoffs when they exhibit information locality: when predictive information about an element is concentrated in its recent past. We provide empirical evidence from three test domains in support of the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis: a reanalysis of a miniature artificial language learning experiment, a large-scale study of word order in corpora of 54 languages, and an analysis of morpheme order in two agglutinative languages. These results suggest that principles of order in natural language can be explained via highly generic cognitively motivated principles and lend support to efficiency-based models of the structure of human language.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling word and morpheme order in natural language as an efficient tradeoff of memory and surprisal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Hahn","Dan Jurafsky","Richard Futrell"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641846263,"objectID":"72832c5a1681b1b95c13618eff878d52","permalink":"https://langprocgroup.github.io/publication/hahn-2021-sensitivity/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T20:24:23.433337Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hahn-2021-sensitivity/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract We introduce a theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the complexity of sequence classification tasks, using a novel extension of the theory of Boolean function sensitivity. The sensitivity of a function, given a distribution over input sequences, quantifies the number of disjoint subsets of the input sequence that can each be individually changed to change the output. We argue that standard sequence classification methods are biased towards learning low-sensitivity functions, so that tasks requiring high sensitivity are more difficult. To that end, we show analytically that simple lexical classifiers can only express functions of bounded sensitivity, and we show empirically that low-sensitivity functions are easier to learn for LSTMs. We then estimate sensitivity on 15 NLP tasks, finding that sensitivity is higher on challenging tasks collected in GLUE than on simple text classification tasks, and that sensitivity predicts the performance both of simple lexical classifiers and of vanilla BiLSTMs without pretrained contextualized embeddings. Within a task, sensitivity predicts which inputs are hard for such simple models. Our results suggest that the success of massively pretrained contextual representations stems in part because they provide representations from which information can be extracted by low-sensitivity decoders.","tags":[],"title":"Sensitivity as a Complexity Measure for Sequence Classification Tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Futrell","Edward Gibson","Harry J.
